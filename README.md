# SIO - Secure Repository for Organizations

## Project Abstract

The Secure Repository for Organizations is a system built to help organizations manage and share documents securely among their members. It safeguards confidentiality, integrity, and controlled access through the use of encryption, strong session handling, and role-based access control (RBAC).

## Core Capabilities

- **Secure File Storage**: All files are encrypted and stored separately from the main repository data, ensuring the protection of sensitive content.

- **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**: Access permissions are granted based on user roles, enabling scalable and adaptable permission management.

- **Secure Session Management**: Sessions are protected against tampering, interception, replay attacks, and impersonation, ensuring authentication and integrity at all times.

- **Encrypted Data Transmission**: All communications between clients and the server are encrypted, including those from anonymous users, to block unauthorized access.

- **Encrypted Private Data**: All sensitive personal information is securely encrypted at rest within the repository, preserving confidentiality and data integrity.

- **API Access Support**: Provides a full range of APIs for anonymous, authenticated, and role-authorized interactions.
